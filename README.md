## Welcome to David's github profile

David is a cloud-native data engineer, experienced in building data pipelines on the AWS platform. Originally a DNA sequencing bioinformatician, he's discovered the joys of automating data pipelines that connect the physical and digital world. Lego expert.


### Languages and Frameworks

Most of my work is connecting data sources to processing and final outputs or to trigger events in a system. Therefore, I've found that python, javascript and bash commands to be the most useful.

### Cloud Architecture

I also like designing cloud architecture. AWS is my preferred platform as it has a diverse set of lego-like components that easily connect.
